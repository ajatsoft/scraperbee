making a very basic django app with TastyPie installed with some skeleton models and api resource  that would be useful for scraping a website and releasing the data as an API on Heroku. Template model and API assume you are scraping the detail pages of a website with images and some content/metadata for each image.

Edit api/models.py and api/api.py, scrape.py

Untested. I am sleepy.
