making a very basic django app with TastyPie installed with some skeleton models and api resource  that would be useful for scraping a website and deploying an API for scraped website data on Heroku. Template model and API assume you are scraping the detail pages of a website with images and some content/metadata for each image.

Edit api/models.py and api/api.py, scrape.py

Untest. I am sleepy.
